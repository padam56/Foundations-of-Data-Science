### Overview of Lab Session Modules with Python:

[**M1**](Lab-Sessions/M1_Week3-Python-I): Printing, Inputting, Variables, Simple data types, Operators, String processing, Loop and conditional blocks, Functions.

[**M2**](Lab-Sessions/M2_Week5-Python-II): Lists, Tuples, Sets, Dicts, Modules, File Handling, Classes, Magic commands.

M3: Vector arithmetic with Numpy, Relational data with Pandas, Plots with Seaborn.

M4: Data preprocessing - Fill missing values, clean, standardise, normalise.

M5: Descriptive Statistics - Computing measures of statistics, Visualisation with different plot styles.

M6: Probablistic aspects such as Sampling distributions, demonstrating Central Limit Theorem.

M7: Hypothesis testing on single sample (mean, variance, proportion).

M8: Hypothesis testing on two populations with known and unknown mean.

M9: Analysis of variance with one and two factors.

M10: Linear Regression.
